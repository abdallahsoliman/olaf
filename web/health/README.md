# Health Module

This module is responsible for keeping track of one's health & fitness. It interacts with a heart rate monitor (currently using Garmin ANT+) for physical data readings.

## Features
- logs heart rate values at a set interval and presents the data in realtime using a live graph feed
- provides a means to log workout data and will present the data in graph and log form (lifting, running, etc.)
- using heart rate data, analyze sleep patterns, and attempt to detect REM cycles (an alarm component may be included)

As of today, this module is incomplete.
